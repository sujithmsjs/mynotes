request.getSession() will return a current session. if current session does not exist, then it will create a new one.

request.getSession(true) will return current session. If current session does not exist, then it will create a new session.

So basically there is not difference between both method.

request.getSession(false) will return current session if current session exists. If not, it will not create a new session.
