Response always has 
1. Response Headers
2. Response Body
3. Response Status
4. Media Type

We can send all these to Client using Response Entity.

# Eg:-
```java
// import org.springframework.http.ResponseEntity;
@GetMapping("/sample")
public ResponseEntity<Employee> saveEmployee(){
		
Employee emp = new Employee();
var responseEntity  = new ResponseEntity<Employee>(emp, HttpStatus.CREATED);

return responseEntity;
}
```
