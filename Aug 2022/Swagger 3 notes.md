# Swagger 3

*OpenAPI refers to the industry-standard specification for RESTful API design. Swagger refers to a set of SmartBear tools.*

###OpenAPI
The specification itself, formerly known as Swagger specification.
It is an API description format for REST APIs. An OpenAPI file allows you to describe your entire API.

Over the past few years, Swagger has become the standard for defining or documenting your API. Formerly known as the Swagger Specification, this format has been donated to the Open API Initiative (or OAI) which is a Linux Foundation Collaborative Project.

On July 2017, the OpenAPI Specification 3.0.0 was finally released by the Open API Initiative.

### Swagger
Tools used in the implementation of OpenAPI.
Swagger is a set of open-source tools built around the OpenAPI Specification that can help you design, build, document and consume REST APIs.
