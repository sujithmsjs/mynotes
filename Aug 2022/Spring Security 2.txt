### If we mention 2 UserDetailsService? The below error will be displayed.

Description:

Field userDetailsService in com.suji.springsecurity.SpringSecurityApplication required a single bean, but 2 were found:
	- customerService: defined in file [D:\spring-security-workspace\spring-security\target\classes\com\suji\springsecurity\service\CustomerService.class]
	- inMemoryUserDetailsManager: defined by method 'inMemoryUserDetailsManager' in class path resource [com/suji/springsecurity/config/SecurityConfiguration.class]


Action:

Consider marking one of the beans as @Primary, updating the consumer to accept multiple beans, or using @Qualifier to identify the bean that should be consumed
