hey everyone

and welcome to top think today we're

going to learn about 10 habits to become

mentally

stronger now let's begin number one

your biggest fan how often do you talk

to yourself

many people are afraid of self-talk even

though it's one of the most reliable

ways to boost your self-esteem

you might think self-talk is crazy

people but

anyone can use self-talk to their

advantage because everyone has their own

personal narrative your narrative

describes the way you speak to yourself

if you're a negative or insecure person

you might have a malicious narrative

that tears you down

that narrative has a profound impact on

your self-esteem

it decreases your motivation your

courage and your ability to take risks

in other words if your narrative is

hurtful there's a good chance

you'll pay the price so how do you

change your personal narrative

how do you establish a positive

relationship with yourself

every day say something nice to yourself

just take a few seconds to appreciate

your strengths

you might recognize something you're

good at or reflect on an achievement

you're proud of

yeah this may feel strange at first if

you're not accustomed to self-talk

you might shy away from this

embarrassing habit but it's only

embarrassing if you choose to be

embarrassed there's nothing wrong with

talking to yourself and there's nothing

wrong with cheering yourself on

so if you want to boost your mental

strength and change your

self-deprecating narrative

then talk to yourself and be your

biggest fan

number two lessons to learn in life

you'll face all kinds of challenges

you'll struggle with professional

hurdles you'll run face first into

personal obstacles

some challenges will set you back a few

hours and others will occupy your mind

for days weeks or months at a time

but every challenge you face no matter

how large or lofty can be overcome

all you have to do is change your

perspective

when you encounter something that scares

you you have an opportunity

you can back down and give up on your

goals or

you can build your mental strength by

facing that challenge head on

challenging yourself proves that you're

capable of more than you think

but confronting fears can be

intimidating so

how do you empower yourself to overcome

the obstacles

in your life this is one of the most

powerful habits you can learn

the next time you face a difficult

challenge don't think about the

obstacles in your way

don't worry about all the things you

might do wrong

instead view every challenge as a

learning experience

perceive every difficult situation as an

opportunity to learn a lesson

practice a technique or experience

something new

because that strong mentality makes

every obstacle worthwhile

number three emotional awareness

do you engage with your emotions do you

try to understand the way you feel

most people suppress or ignore their

emotions hoping they'll disappear

but mentally strong people investigate

their emotions because

your emotions when you look deep inside

yourself

guide you toward a sense of purpose

meaning and fulfillment in your life

your emotions teach you how to find your

own definition of success

so don't stifle the way you feel don't

put up walls or pretend like nothing

bothers you

instead lean into your emotions try to

identify

each of the emotions you're feeling and

spend time reflecting on how those

emotions affect your decisions

and your lifestyle over time you'll

develop a more sophisticated

understanding of your feelings

and that knowledge will make you a

stronger person

number four controlled responses

life throws all kinds of surprises at

you some are good some

are bad some you can prepare for and

others you can't

in other words you can't control what

happens to you in your life

you can't control the people around you

you can't control the way the world

works

but there is something you can control

no matter what surprises burst into your

life

you can always control the way you react

when things don't go their way most

people react with a string of negative

emotions

feelings like hopelessness fear and

denial

in these moments it's easy for your

motivation to collapse

and your fears to take over the

strongest people on the other hand are

unwaveringly positive

the world may throw crazy obstacles in

their path but they

find a silver lining in every setback

they see an opportunity in every failure

and they can always pinpoint a reason

to keep pushing at the end of the day

these mentally strong people can only

control the way

they react they don't know what the

future holds but the way you approach

your future

makes all the difference

number five the inevitable storm

sooner or later things will go wrong

it's a fact of life

everyone is bound to fail sometime

because no one overcomes

every obstacle on the first try that's

why failure is a fundamental experience

shared by every person on the planet so

how do you turn

failure into mental fortitude failure

is like a natural disaster it rattles

your life

destroys your livelihood and it leaves

you picking up the pieces

many are surprised when this storm

devastates their ambitions or lifestyle

but you know this storm is coming if

failure is

inevitable then you need to get ready

mentally strong people are prepared for

a violent storm to shake their life

they know things might fall apart and

when that storm finally comes their

preparation

saves them from disaster instead of

crumbling into a million tiny pieces

they catch themselves when they fall

they minimize the damage done and they

rebuild their ambitions

stronger than ever number six

daily training do you improve your

mental strength every day

like any lifestyle habit mental

fortitude is a product of daily exercise

you'll never develop an unstoppable

mindset in a single afternoon

rather mental strength is developed over

months of consistent practice

so if you're trying to get in touch with

your emotions for example spend a little

time

introspecting every day you may not

succeed at first but over time you'll

discover a unique sense of comfort and

clarity

each time you practice your mental

strength keep this framework in mind

you don't have to train for hours at a

time because strong habits are developed

in small increments

you may not see drastic improvement

overnight but if you stick with it you

can transform the way you think

and the way you live number seven

risky confidence how often do you take

risks

taking risks is a difficult thing to do

it requires a strong combination of

courage foresight and enthusiasm

above all you have to believe in your

ability to try new things

you have to believe you will rise to the

occasion

but how do you develop that kind of

confidence in yourself

risk taking is a key component of both

confidence and mental strength

if you want to have faith in yourself

then you have to prove you're worthy of

your own belief

earn confidence and self-belief by

pushing yourself into uncharted

territory

do something uncomfortable face a tough

challenge or confront a long-standing

fear

the more personal the better because

each risk you take

builds your confidence each ounce of

success teaches you to have faith in

yourself

and shows you just how much you can do

number eight embarrassing yourself are

you afraid of looking stupid or out of

place

do you hold yourself back because you

worry about what other people think

this destructive habit will stand in

your way for years to come

it's one of the most common problems in

the world and it's not going away

anytime soon

the simple fact is the more you worry

about what people think

the less you will accomplish because all

that paranoia

all that fear stops you from doing

things you want to do

it discourages you from taking risks

because you're afraid of looking foolish

mentally strong people embarrass

themselves on a regular basis

they let themselves be awkward

uncomfortable and clueless

they try things they're terrible at

knowing just how stupid they're going to

look

why do they put themselves in these

embarrassing situations

because each awkward moment teaches you

to be comfortable in your own skin

the more uncomfortable situations you

face the stronger you're going to be

number nine lazy work it's no secret

that mentally strong people have

incredible work ethics but where does

that work ethic come from

when you're feeling lazy the last thing

you want to do is work

you don't want to worry about little

details solve problems or worry about

some big project

you want to turn off your brain and save

your work for later

most people do exactly that when they're

feeling lazy they surrender to these

destructive feelings and accomplish very

little but mentally strong

people lean into their mental resistance

if their brain is putting up a fight

they push themselves harder

because that's what a strong work ethic

looks like anyone can work when they're

feeling inspired

but only the strongest people can work

when they're lazy and sluggish

number 10 spread positivity

you're going to meet some rude people in

your life when you meet these people you

can respond in one of two ways

you can lash out or you can turn the

other cheek

mentally strong people are some of the

kindest individuals that you'll ever

meet

no matter how you approach them they're

always friendly and personable

why because their constant kindness sets

the tone for their entire lives

no matter how many negative people walk

into their world a mentally strong

person keeps their spirits up

and their mood positive negativity is

infectious and sour people can damage

your motivation your attitude and your

general demeanor

so be kind be friendly and spread

positivity
