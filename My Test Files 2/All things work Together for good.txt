1 Thess 5:18
Give Thanks in every curcumtences.

Experience + Intimasy = Level of Faith in God.
Logos: Intentions/thoughts/heart of God

Own fake image of God: if you don't know God.
You can't grow in faith, without knowing God.
Just not know Him, experience Him.

All things work together for Good.
Rom 8:28

1 Jer 29:11 CSV
I have plans for you.

Even what is seems like a desaster now, is gonna be trun into Good for you.
Wait for Him to promote/elevate/deliver you.

God is constantly working/shaping/molding each one of us
to fulfil our destiny.
