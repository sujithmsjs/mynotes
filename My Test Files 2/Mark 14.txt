Leaven, used in this context, is that which has its origin in the deception of the enemy and is contrary to the truth of the Word which has its outworking in all unrighteousness which is sin (1 John 5:17).

The ancient peoples used to gather yeast on grape leaves to leaven their bread if they needed to speed up the process, but God said "Don't even let any leavening touch the dough. Just bake it and go."

God then told them that in the future they were to commemorate this feast by getting all yeast out of the house for seven days.
