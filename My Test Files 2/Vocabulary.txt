Bike Driving
----------
1. Getting the Right Gear
The correct fit puts the eye port just above your eyebrows with a very tight fit of your finger between your head and the helmet.
Your helmet needs to have a snug fit to protect your head properly.
For the most comprehensive protection, look at full face or modular helmets.

2. Get a jacket.
If you opt for a leather jacket, make sure it’s motorcycle specific.
Besides protection, jackets also provide protection from environmental conditions, such as sun, wind, precipitation, and cold temperatures.


3. Get motorcycle boots, gloves, and other gear.
Boots provide protection to your feet and ankles. 
Gloves provide protection to your hands.
Pants provide protection to your hips and legs.

Your feet can take a lot of abuse while riding, so protect them.

The purpose of gloves is to reduce injury from being hit by insects and flying debris, as well as keep your fingers warm.

Get ones that allow for maximum dexterity.
Pants are often overlooked.

Familiarize yourself with the basic controls before riding.
