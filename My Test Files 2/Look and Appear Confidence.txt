Look and Appear Confident
----------------------
I want to shatter that confidence myth and tell you how confidence isn’t something that arrives at birth. It’s a skill, one that can be developed like any other skill, through intentional practice.

Nonverbal communication makes up a minimum of 60 percent of our communication ability. So, if you only focus on your words, you are using only 40 percent of your ability. You have to get into the habit of portraying confidence with both your verbal and nonverbal communication.


We innately get bigger in our bodies when we feel prideful, but get smaller in our bodies when we feel defeated or ashamed.
This study proves that our nonverbal responses to pride and defeat aren’t expressions we learn from seeing others win or lose. Instead, they are responses that are coded within us.

Claim territory
First, the easiest way to look like a winner is to claim territory.

Own your body and own the space around you by standing or sitting tall. Keep your arms loose by your side or place one or both hands on your hips. Relax your shoulders down your back and open your chest. These expansive postures will show others that you’re confident and sure of yourself. Be wary of low power postures, such as crossing your arms or turtling your shoulders to your ears as this may signal defeat.

participants in a mock interview who sat up straight reported a better mood and higher self-esteem compared to their slouched counterparts.

From the study:
The upright participants reported feeling more enthusiastic, excited, and strong, while the slumped participants reported feeling more fearful, hostile, nervous, quiet, still, passive, dull, sleepy, and sluggish.

The power of eye gazing
Confident people know the power of eye gazing.
To increase your confidence, be sure to look people in the eye as you are speaking AND as they are speaking.
Too often we look away, check our phone or scope out the rest of the room. This is not only rude, but very low confident.

Engage in fronting
Fronting is when you aim your torso and toes toward the person you are speaking with. Nonverbally, this is a sign of respect. When you do this, you look incredibly focused, confident, put together and charismatic. Be sure to always keep your toes and torso aimed at the person you are speaking with.

Action Step: Practice claiming space, making eye contact and fronting in your next conversation.

The vocal power
When you answer the phone and when you start a new conversation, it’s crucial that your voice projects your inner confidence. 

Happy Hello (Thinking of something that made them happy and holding a Happiness Microexpression.)
This is a huge finding as it shows people can hear your mood.

Action Step: Your mood affects your voice. We like hearing happy moods and we don’t like hearing irritable moods. Reserve your phone calls for when you’re in a quiet place, you’re calm and you’re settled. Resist the urge to answer when you’re stuck in traffic or having a bad day.

Avoid the Question Inflection

One of the biggest mistakes people make with nonverbal confidence is with their voice tone.

Confident people never use the question inflection for statements.
For example, be careful not to say your name as a question like “My name is Vanessa?” You want to make it authoritative by going down at the end of the sentence. “My name is Vanessa.”

AUTHORITATIVE TONE

Make sure to use the authoritative tone whenever you answer a question to show you are sure of your words.

Research has found that women who use the question inflection are seen as less trustworthy by men.

How to Be Confident with Social Anxiety

SOCIAL ANXIETY
Social anxiety is when you feel nervous, tense or uncomfortable in social situations because you’re worried other people are judging you.


Unfortunately, social anxiety can suppress our inner confidence and make it feel impossible to be social in an authentic way. The good news is there are ways to overcome your social anxiety with a treatment known as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy or CBT.

CBT is a set of activities proven to reduce your anxiety through repeated practice. It consists of two main parts: cognitive therapy and behavioral therapy.

Walk Confidently

A nervous walker moves faster, with the arms held tightly at the sides. A relaxed walker moves more slowly, with the arms loose by the sides.
