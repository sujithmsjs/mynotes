== compares reference values, not object values.

Which collection class allows you to associate its elements with key values, and allows you to retrieve objects in FIFO (first-in, first-out) sequence?
java.util.LinkedHashMap

LinkedHashMap is the collection class used for caching purposes. FIFO is another way to indicate caching behavior. To retrieve LinkedHashMap elements in cached order, use the values() method and iterate over the resultant collection.

Hashtable is the only class listed that provides synchronized methods. If you need synchronization great; otherwise, use HashMap, it's faster.
