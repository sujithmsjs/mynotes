• If I could pay 3 lakhs, I would get 8 lakhs package. What can I do? And again I thought If I had that money, I would build my own career.
• What If I get a job as a fresher? I need consultancy where I could get daily notifications regarding job.

DON'T LATE
Whatever you thinking make if fast, the minute you late might push you a little more corner. You must take an action instead of thinking too much long.

Please do take an action before it too late.

DON'T LET THEM COME TO YOUR HEART.
Don't let anyone destroy your inner peace. Just forget as if they were not even exists in you life. Try to have peace of mind. Think like their existience doesn't add a meaning to your life. All you can do it, just be yourself, don't let them spoil you inner peace.

WHAT IF THEY AVOID YOU.
You better get avoided just because you might get more time to focus on yourself. Your career is more important than anything else. So let them waste your valuable time by pusing worthless talk and impurity. It is much better to avoid chat/call then to put yourself in unconfortable position.
