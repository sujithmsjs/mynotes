[Music] hey everyone and welcome to top think today we're going to learn about 10 habits to become mentally stronger now let's begin number one your biggest fan how often do you talk to yourself many people are afraid of self-talk even though it's one of the most reliable ways to boost your self-esteem you might think self-talk is crazy people but anyone can use self-talk to their advantage because everyone has their own personal narrative your narrative describes the way you speak to yourself if you're a negative or insecure person you might have a malicious narrative that tears you down that narrative has a profound impact on your self-esteem it decreases your motivation your courage and your ability to take risks in other words if your narrative is hurtful there's a good chance you'll pay the price so how do you change your personal narrative how do you establish a positive relationship with yourself every day say something nice to yourself just take a few seconds to appreciate your strengths you might recognize something you're good at or reflect on an achievement you're proud of yeah this may feel strange at first if you're not accustomed to self-talk you might shy away from this embarrassing habit but it's only embarrassing if you choose to be embarrassed there's nothing wrong with talking to yourself and there's nothing wrong with cheering yourself on so if you want to boost your mental strength and change your self-deprecating narrative then talk to yourself and be your biggest fan number two lessons to learn in life you'll face all kinds of challenges you'll struggle with professional hurdles you'll run face first into personal obstacles some challenges will set you back a few hours and others will occupy your mind for days weeks or months at a time but every challenge you face no matter how large or lofty can be overcome all you have to do is change your perspective when you encounter something that scares you you have an opportunity you can back down and give up on your goals or you can build your mental strength by facing that challenge head on challenging yourself proves that you're capable of more than you think but confronting fears can be intimidating so how do you empower yourself to overcome the obstacles in your life this is one of the most powerful habits you can learn the next time you face a difficult challenge don't think about the obstacles in your way don't worry about all the things you might do wrong instead view every challenge as a learning experience perceive every difficult situation as an opportunity to learn a lesson practice a technique or experience something new because that strong mentality makes every obstacle worthwhile number three emotional awareness do you engage with your emotions do you try to understand the way you feel most people suppress or ignore their emotions hoping they'll disappear but mentally strong people investigate their emotions because your emotions when you look deep inside yourself guide you toward a sense of purpose meaning and fulfillment in your life your emotions teach you how to find your own definition of success so don't stifle the way you feel don't put up walls or pretend like nothing bothers you instead lean into your emotions try to identify each of the emotions you're feeling and spend time reflecting on how those emotions affect your decisions and your lifestyle over time you'll develop a more sophisticated understanding of your feelings and that knowledge will make you a stronger person number four controlled responses life throws all kinds of surprises at you some are good some are bad some you can prepare for and others you can't in other words you can't control what happens to you in your life you can't control the people around you you can't control the way the world works but there is something you can control no matter what surprises burst into your life you can always control the way you react when things don't go their way most people react with a string of negative emotions feelings like hopelessness fear and denial in these moments it's easy for your motivation to collapse and your fears to take over the strongest people on the other hand are unwaveringly positive the world may throw crazy obstacles in their path but they find a silver lining in every setback they see an opportunity in every failure and they can always pinpoint a reason to keep pushing at the end of the day these mentally strong people can only control the way they react they don't know what the future holds but the way you approach your future makes all the difference number five the inevitable storm sooner or later things will go wrong it's a fact of life everyone is bound to fail sometime because no one overcomes every obstacle on the first try that's why failure is a fundamental experience shared by every person on the planet so how do you turn failure into mental fortitude failure is like a natural disaster it rattles your life destroys your livelihood and it leaves you picking up the pieces many are surprised when this storm devastates their ambitions or lifestyle but you know this storm is coming if failure is inevitable then you need to get ready mentally strong people are prepared for a violent storm to shake their life they know things might fall apart and when that storm finally comes their preparation saves them from disaster instead of crumbling into a million tiny pieces they catch themselves when they fall they minimize the damage done and they rebuild their ambitions stronger than ever number six daily training do you improve your mental strength every day like any lifestyle habit mental fortitude is a product of daily exercise you'll never develop an unstoppable mindset in a single afternoon rather mental strength is developed over months of consistent practice so if you're trying to get in touch with your emotions for example spend a little time introspecting every day you may not succeed at first but over time you'll discover a unique sense of comfort and clarity each time you practice your mental strength keep this framework in mind you don't have to train for hours at a time because strong habits are developed in small increments you may not see drastic improvement overnight but if you stick with it you can transform the way you think and the way you live number seven risky confidence how often do you take risks taking risks is a difficult thing to do it requires a strong combination of courage foresight and enthusiasm above all you have to believe in your ability to try new things you have to believe you will rise to the occasion but how do you develop that kind of confidence in yourself risk taking is a key component of both confidence and mental strength if you want to have faith in yourself then you have to prove you're worthy of your own belief earn confidence and self-belief by pushing yourself into uncharted territory do something uncomfortable face a tough challenge or confront a long-standing fear the more personal the better because each risk you take builds your confidence each ounce of success teaches you to have faith in yourself and shows you just how much you can do number eight embarrassing yourself are you afraid of looking stupid or out of place do you hold yourself back because you worry about what other people think this destructive habit will stand in your way for years to come it's one of the most common problems in the world and it's not going away anytime soon the simple fact is the more you worry about what people think the less you will accomplish because all that paranoia all that fear stops you from doing things you want to do it discourages you from taking risks because you're afraid of looking foolish mentally strong people embarrass themselves on a regular basis they let themselves be awkward uncomfortable and clueless they try things they're terrible at knowing just how stupid they're going to look why do they put themselves in these embarrassing situations because each awkward moment teaches you to be comfortable in your own skin the more uncomfortable situations you face the stronger you're going to be number nine lazy work it's no secret that mentally strong people have incredible work ethics but where does that work ethic come from when you're feeling lazy the last thing you want to do is work you don't want to worry about little details solve problems or worry about some big project you want to turn off your brain and save your work for later most people do exactly that when they're feeling lazy they surrender to these destructive feelings and accomplish very little but mentally strong people lean into their mental resistance if their brain is putting up a fight they push themselves harder because that's what a strong work ethic looks like anyone can work when they're feeling inspired but only the strongest people can work when they're lazy and sluggish number 10 spread positivity you're going to meet some rude people in your life when you meet these people you can respond in one of two ways you can lash out or you can turn the other cheek mentally strong people are some of the kindest individuals that you'll ever meet no matter how you approach them they're always friendly and personable why because their constant kindness sets the tone for their entire lives no matter how many negative people walk into their world a mentally strong person keeps their spirits up and their mood positive negativity is infectious and sour people can damage your motivation your attitude and your general demeanor so be kind be friendly and spread positivity wherever you go hey thank you for watching top think and
