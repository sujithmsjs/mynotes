IoC (Inversion of Control)  that supports objects to give their dependencies rather than looking for creating dependent objects.


Spring container forms the core of the Spring Framework.

Spring Container
The Spring container uses Dependency Injection (DI) for managing the application components by creating objects, wiring them together along with configuring and managing their overall life cycles.

Dependency Injection:
You don’t have to create your objects but you just have to describe how they should be created.
The IoC container present in Spring will wire them up together.

2 Major ways
1. Constructor injection
2. Setter injection



Spring beans are instantiated, configured, wired, and managed by IoC container.

Configuration meta data
1. XML based
2. Java based @Configuration, @Bean
3. Annotation based @Component, @ComponentScan
