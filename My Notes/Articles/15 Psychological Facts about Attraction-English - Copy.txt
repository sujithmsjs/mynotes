hey everyone and welcome to top think today 
we're going to learn about 15 psychological facts  

about attraction now let's begin number one 
threshold of attraction has anyone ever asked  

you what's your type right now you may be fond 
of a specific look but your type changes based on  

your relationship status when you're single your 
threshold for romantic attraction is low and broad  

you're attracted to a wide range of people 
because you're unsure what kind of person will  

make you happy when you're in a relationship your 
preferences change your threshold for attraction  

gets much higher you already have a partner 
so you don't find the same people attractive  

now of course you still find other people 
attractive those preferences never disappear  

even in long-term relationships you may be 
perfectly happy with your partner but you can  

still be attracted to other people number two 
attraction control some people are born with  

attractive features but here's a psychological 
fact that most people don't know about attraction  

your most attractive features are entirely under 
your control you can't change your height or the  

shape of your face you're stuck with those things 
for life but you can influence your health your  

grooming and your wardrobe just think about the 
physical features that attractive people have in  

common attractive faces come in all shapes and 
sizes and each of these faces looks different  

and unique yet we find them all attractive so why 
is that it's not because of their innate physical  

features it's because of the traits they can 
control like style and fitness if you don't  

think you're attractive don't say i just wasn't 
born that way because your appearance is yours  

to control number three emotional rapport have you 
ever watched couples interact maybe you thought to  

yourself wow they have great chemistry chemistry 
is one of the biggest mysteries in romantic  

relationships how do you create chemistry with 
another person is it magic or is there a reason  

why some people have chemistry and some people 
don't to build chemistry you have to build rapport  

rapport is a complicated social relationship built 
upon deeper knowledge and mutual understanding you  

might have heard the term in a business context 
but it's even more important in a relationship  

so the next time you're around a strong couple 
pay attention to the way they talk to each other  

it almost feels like they're having 
several conversations at once  

one on the surface and another below the surface 
when you have great chemistry only you and your  

partner can communicate in a way only you 
two understand but how do you build chemistry  

it's easier than you think the best way to build 
chemistry is conversation be yourself make jokes  

get to know each other on a deeper level because 
that's where chemistry comes from number four  

facial similarity so what kind of people are 
you attracted to you may be drawn to people  

that share many of your own qualities your style 
is a good example you may pursue partners with  

a similar sense of fashion so if you like to 
dress down chances are your partner does too  

we see the same pattern in physical features like 
hair color it's not uncommon for romantic couples  

to look alike but why do we fall for people who 
look like us because you look at yourself every  

day you think about how many times you've looked 
at your face in the mirror your features are the  

features you're used to your attractiveness 
is how you judge the attractiveness of others  

so don't be surprised if you and your 
partner have characteristics in common  

number five smile frequency how often 
do you smile a study from the american  

psychological association found that women are 
perceived as more attractive when they smile  

frequently traits like positivity and confidence 
are associated with happy facial expressions  

like a genuine smile so it's no surprise that men 
consider women more desirable when they're smiling  

ah but the opposite is true for men women perceive 
men as more attractive when they smile sparingly  

many women prefer brooding personality types 
similar to reserved characters in movies and books  

but you shouldn't change your facial 
expressions to make you more attractive  

that's not the takeaway here the takeaway is this 
facial expression sends strong messages about your  

attitude and your personality smiling or frowning 
it speaks volumes about who you really are number  

six the hair limit is facial hair attractive or 
unattractive on average men with stubble were  

rated as more attractive than men who were clean 
shaven but there's a limit to how long your beard  

should grow men with longer fuller beards were 
also considered less attractive than men with  

stubble so don't be afraid to grow out your facial 
hair just make sure you keep it short and clean  

number seven bold communication many men and 
women play hard to get they act like they don't  

care they pretend to be cool and carefree but 
their disinterest pushes their partners away  

the most attractive people send the opposite 
message they use bold and confident body language  

they send clear messages and express their 
wants needs and feelings these people aren't  

afraid to communicate their interest and that 
communication makes them even more attractive  

number eight the hidden sense physical attraction 
involves all five senses we're attracted to the  

way someone looks we're attracted to the sound 
of someone's voice and we're also attracted  

to the way someone smells a smell can be so 
powerful that it overwhelms you with desire  

for another person the unique smell of a partner 
for example can trigger a wide range of emotions  

from comfort to attraction so to make yourself 
more attractive pay attention to the way you smell  

create a unique scent for yourself because your 
scent could be one of your most attractive traits  

number nine influential media how do you decide 
who's attractive and who isn't our standards are  

influenced heavily by the media we are constantly 
exposed to models actors and other celebrities  

whose appearances define modern romance when 
looking at strangers we subconsciously measure  

their attractiveness against the people we idolize 
but we treat partners a little differently you  

may think someone's attractive based on popular 
traits but you're more likely to choose a partner  

who's uniquely attractive to you number 10 the 
beauty bias is there a beauty bias in our culture  

unfortunately attractive people have more 
opportunities than less attractive people  

on average they're perceived as more intelligent 
more confident and more successful they're more  

likely to get job offers make more money and 
make good first impressions so why do attractive  

people have an advantage well because most of us 
have a weak spot for people we find attractive  

when you encounter someone you find attractive you 
automatically make certain assumptions about them  

you want to like them and you want them to like 
you so does a beauty bias exist in the world today  

absolutely number 11 attractive popularity 
sometimes your physical attractiveness has  

nothing to do with you all right let's say a 
guy is sitting next to his girlfriend because  

he's captured the attention of one woman he's 
more likely to capture the attention of others  

the attention you receive is one 
way that we measure attraction  

if you're constantly being fond over others 
will subconsciously find you attractive  

if you're constantly being ignored 
then you may experience the opposite  

number 12 tonal changes when you're flirting 
with someone you like your voice actually changes  

this comes from a 2010 study in 
the journal of non-verbal behavior  

researchers found that men and women speak in a 
lower register when they find someone attractive  

but that's not all men and women are also 
more likely to be attracted to someone's voice  

if they find them physically attractive 
too in other words your voice and vocal  

preferences influence the people 
you like and the people who like you  

number 13 attractive colors are some colors more 
attractive than others well the most attractive  

color is also the symbolic color of love on 
average women who wear red are rated as more  

attractive than women who wear any other color 
but why is red more attractive than a color like  

blue well red communicates powerful subliminal 
messages which impact your attraction to another  

person it's a bold daring color that we naturally 
associate with romance attraction and love so how  

can you give your physical appearance an instant 
boost just incorporate more red into your wardrobe  

number 14 musical atmosphere music can have 
a psychological impact on your attraction  

and your attractiveness when listening to the 
right music you can experience a person in a  

completely different way music creates atmospheres 
and atmosphere sets the tone of any interaction  

this effect was carefully examined in a 2014 
study from the journal psychology of music  

researchers analyzed the romantic 
attraction of conversation partners with  

and without music playing it turns out 
the addition of music significantly  

increase their physical and emotional connections 
in other words turn on some music even if it's not  

the perfect song the presence of background 
music can make you a more attractive option  

number 15 familiar attraction familiarity is one 
of the most powerful motivators of attraction the  

more familiar someone feels the closer you feel 
to them now you won't be attracted to everyone you  

feel close to however it's very likely that the 
person you fall for will be intimately involved  

in your life for example you may be attracted 
to someone who works at your favorite restaurant  

you see this person relatively often so they 
feel more familiar you've gotten to know them  

better and over time your attraction has grown 
stronger even if this person isn't attractive  

to the rest of the world their familiarity 
makes them attractive to you hey thank you
