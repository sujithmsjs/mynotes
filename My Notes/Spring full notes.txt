Springbook full notes:

Auto Configuration
Spring Boot Auto Configuration automatically configures your Spring application based on 
the JAR dependencies you added in the project.


If you added @SpringBootApplication annotation to the class, you do not need to add 
the @EnableAutoConfiguration, @ComponentScan and @SpringBootConfiguration
annotation.

Important Annoatations:

@RestController
@ComponentScan
@RequestMapping


Main Method:
This class should be 
annotated with @SpringBootApplication.

Rest Endpoint:
@RestController


The @ComponentScan annotation is used to find beans and the corresponding
injected with @Autowired annotation.



@SpringBootApplication
 |-@EnableAutoConfiguration
 |-@ComponentScan
 |-@Configuration


Runners
Application Runner and Command Line Runner interfaces lets you to execute the code 
after the Spring Boot application is started.


@SpringBootApplication
public class DemoApplication implements ApplicationRunner {
public static void main(String[] args) {
SpringApplication.run(DemoApplication.class, args);
}

@Override
public void run(ApplicationArguments arg0) throws Exception {
}
}


@SpringBootApplication
public class DemoApplication implements CommandLineRunner {
}
