https://tickledthink.com/5-easy-ways-to-stop-being-broke-right-now/

1. Determine your Financial Goal and Create a Financial Plan: I need to have a proper financial plan to save money and to multiply money.
2. Learn to live below your means: You don't need show to others that you are rich. I want a new bike FZ-Ver3 but I don't wanna pay every monthly pay bills of bike when my salary is still low. I need peaceful of mind then to have this kind of expensive bike. I can do enjoy even with the simple middle class bike. I need to change my thinking that future is more bright and you have more time to enjoy peacefully even without thinking about the money!
3. Stop choosing convenience over savings: Yeah for me I love to eat outside and love to order in swiggy its very convenience. I do not know how to cook food but I could say that cooking can reduce my expenses.
4. Organize your finances: You should organize your salary.
5. Stop choosing instant gratification:
