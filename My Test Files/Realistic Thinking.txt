Realistic Thinking

Many think that having an optimistic outlook is the secret to happiness. However, optimism and pessimism both have risks.

When you focus on realistic thinking, you’re prioritizing reality, which can help you understand situations you’re in instead of being greatly disappointed or fooling yourself. 

Both pessimistic and optimistic thinking puts your mind in a fantasy world. You’re either thinking about the worst thing that could happen or the best possible outcome. These ways of thinking don’t account for reality. ‌

Optimistic and pessimistic thinking are at the ends of a spectrum. And the midpoint is realism.


Realistic thinking means looking at all aspects of a situation (the positive, the negative, and the neutral) before making conclusions. In other words, realistic thinking means looking at yourself, others, and the world in a balanced and fair way.

Realistic thinking helps us accept the bad and the good in life. It helps us come to terms with the fact that no end of positive thought can make us control every aspect of our life. This allows us to break free from deluded thinking that may lead to despair.

Realistic thinking requires cold, hard facts as it’s based on real, actual possibilities.

Positive thinking was just as bad as negative thinking, as this false view of life actually worked against the individual.

Realistic thinking is where real hope is found; helping us hit the right balance between realism and aspirations.
