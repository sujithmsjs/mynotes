Bucket Versioning

Versioning is a means of keeping multiple variants of an object in the same bucket. You can use versioning to preserve, retrieve, and restore every version of every object stored in your Amazon S3 bucket. With versioning, you can easily recover from both unintended user actions and application failures.

MFA
Multi-factor authentication delete:

An additional layer of security that requires multi-factor authentication for changing Bucket Versioning settings and permanently deleting object versions. To modify MFA delete settings, use the AWS CLI, AWS SDK, or the Amazon S3 REST API.
