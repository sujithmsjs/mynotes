What is RDBMS?
RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management System.

RDBMS is a program used to maintain a relational database.

RDBMS is the basis for all modern database systems such as MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, and Microsoft Access.

RDBMS uses SQL queries to access the data in the database.


What is a Database Table?
A table is a collection of related data entries, and it consists of columns and rows.
A column holds specific information about every record in the table.

What is Record?
A record (or row) is each individual entry that exists in a table.

What is a Relational Database?
A relational database defines database relationships in the form of tables. The tables are related to each other - based on data common to each.


What is SQL?
SQL is the standard language for dealing with Relational Databases.

SQL is used to insert, search, update, and delete database records.

SQL is used to insert, search, update, and delete database records.

Some of The Most Important SQL Commands
SELECT - extracts data from a database
UPDATE - updates data in a database
DELETE - deletes data from a database
INSERT INTO - inserts new data into a database
CREATE DATABASE - creates a new database
ALTER DATABASE - modifies a database
CREATE TABLE - creates a new table
ALTER TABLE - modifies a table
DROP TABLE - deletes a table
CREATE INDEX - creates an index (search key)
DROP INDEX - deletes an index


What is ResultSet?
The SELECT statement is used to select data from a database.
The data returned is stored in a result table, called the result-set.

SELECT * FROM emp;
SELECT empno, ename FROM emp;

DISTINCT Statement
The SELECT DISTINCT statement is used to return only distinct (different) values.

Inside a table, a column often contains many duplicate values; and sometimes you only want to list the different (distinct) values.

SELECT DISTINCT deptno FROM emp;

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT n2,n3) from num;

Note: It will give you unique rows in selected ResultSet.


select * from emp where sal < 1250;
Not included 1250 sal.

select * from emp where sal <= 1250;
Included 1250 sal.

select * from emp where sal >= 1250;
select * from emp where sal > 1250;

select ename from emp where sal = 1250;
'WARD'
'MARTIN'

select ename from emp where sal <> 1250;

SELECT SAL FROM emp WHERE SAL BETWEEN 1300 AND 1600 ORDER BY SAL;


Below both queries gives same results.
SELECT SAL FROM emp WHERE SAL BETWEEN 1250 AND 1600 ORDER BY SAL;
SELECT SAL FROM emp WHERE SAL>= 1250 AND SAL<=1600;

Enames starts with 'S':
SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE ENAME LIKE 's%'


MySQL Comments

mysql> SELECT 1+1;     # This comment continues to the end of line
mysql> SELECT 1+1;     -- This comment continues to the end of line
mysql> SELECT 1 /* this is an in-line comment */ + 1;
mysql> SELECT 1+
