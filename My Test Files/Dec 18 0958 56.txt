IAM USERS:

An IAM User is an entity created in AWS that provides a way to interact with AWS resources.

The credentials created for IAM User are what exactly uniquely identify themselves to AWS.

IAM ROLE:
A role is a set of permissions that grant access to actions and resources in AWS. These permissions are attached to the role, not to an IAM User or a group.

A role is not uniquely associated with a single person; it can be used by anyone who needs it.
