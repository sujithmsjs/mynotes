Jesus Heals a Demon-Possessed Boy

Jesus said to them, “You faithless people! How long must I be with you? How long must I put up with you? Bring the boy to me.”

Boy's father: Have mercy on us and help us, if you can.
Jesus: What do you mean, ‘If I can’? Anything is possible if a person believes.
The father instantly cried out, “I do believe, but help me overcome my unbelief!”

IT'S OVER- MENTALITY
A murmur ran through the crowd as people said, “He’s dead.” But Jesus took him by the hand and helped him to his feet, and he stood up.

Jesus replied, “This kind can be cast out only by prayer.”

The Greatest in the Kingdom
Whoever wants to be first must take last place and be the servant of everyone else.

 If anyone gives you even a cup of water because you belong to the Messiah, I tell you the truth, that person will surely be rewarded.

SAVE YOUR SALTY
Salt is good for seasoning. But if it loses its flavor, how do you make it salty again? You must have the qualities of salt among yourselves and live in peace with each other.
