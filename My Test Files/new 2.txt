1. Why Platform independent lang?
Compiler: Code > Byte code
- runtime environment (JRE) needed.

2. Stack memory - Heap memory
Stack- Individual program, vars, methods
Heap- global, objects

Instance variables are those variables that are accessible by all the methods in the class. All the objects of the class will have their copy of the variables for utilization.


Local variables are those variables present within a block, function, or constructor and can be accessed only inside them. restricted to the block scope.

Variable might not be initialized: We need to initialize the value before using it.


Data encapsulation: Data Encapsulation is an Object-Oriented Programming concept of hiding the data attributes and their behaviours in a single unit.
- modularity 
-  ensuring that each object is independent
- security of the private properties
