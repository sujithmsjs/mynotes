Mark 13
Jesus Foretells Destruction of the Temple

Magnificent buildings!
Impressive stones
demolished

Don't let anyone mislead you.


Signs
1. Don’t let anyone mislead you,  for many will come in my name, claiming, ‘I am the Messiah.’
2.They will deceive many.
3. And you will hear of wars and threats of wars, but don’t panic.
4. Nation will go to war against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.
5. There will be earthquakes in many parts of the world, as well as famines. 
6. But this is only the first of the birth pains, with more to come.


The Abomination of Desolation
The sacrilegious object that causes desecration
calamity

Warning
1. False messiahs
2. False prophets
will rise up and perform signs and wonders so as to deceive, if possible, even God’s chosen ones.

31 Heaven and earth will disappear, but my words will never disappear.

Be on guard! Stay alert

Don’t let him find you sleeping when he arrives without warning. I say to you what I say to everyone: Watch for him!”
