the traditional SQL-based relational database was less equipped to handle rapidly expanding data volumes and the growing complexities of data structures

 In the last decade, the non-relational, NoSQL databases became more popular for offering a more flexible, scalable, cost-efficient, alternative to the traditional SQL-based relational databases.
 
 
  In the last decade, the non-relational, NoSQL databases became more popular for offering a more flexible, scalable, cost-efficient, alternative to the traditional SQL-based relational databases.
  
  Relational databases are table-based. NoSQL databases can be document based, graph databases, key-value pairs, or wide-column stores.
  
  NoSQL databases are designed to handle the more complex, unstructured data, (such as texts, social media posts, photos, videos, email) which increasingly make up much of the data that exists today.
  
MongoDB:
HuMONGOus: extremely large : huge a humongous building humongous amounts of money.

MongoDB is the most popular and treading database.

Vendor: MongoDB corp

Atlasâ†’Multi-cloud database platform

Where we can use?
* Everywhere!
1. Desktop Apps
2. Mobile Apps
3. Web Applications


FULL STATCK DEVELOPER:
STACK --->: To develop WEB APPS
The technologies which can be used to develop web apps r called a stack.

STACKS:
1. MEAN STACK DEVELOPER
------------------------
M - MongoDB
E - Express
A - Angular
N - Node JS

2. MERN STACK  DEVELOPER
------------------------
M - MongoDB
E - Express
R - React JS
N - Node JS

1. Front End
(Angular, React JS)
2. Back End
(Express JS)
3. Server side runtime environment
(Node JS)
4. Database
(MongoDB)

Note: 2 & 3 Back End

1. NOTE
BY USING MEAN AND MERN STACKS WE CAN BUILD JAVASCRIPT BASED WEB APPLICATIONS.

2. NOTE:
MONGODB IS ALSO BASED ON JAVASCRIPT.

MangoDB internally uses Mozilla's Spider Monkey JavaScript Engine.

3. What is the type of MongoDB database?
NoSQL Database/Document Database

Relational Database vs Document Database
---------------------------------
There r 2 most common types of DBs.
1. RDB RELATIONAL_DS/SQL
- Tables has fixed schema(Structure)
- Tables has Relationships
- has Joins
Ex: Oracle, MySQL, DB2 etc

2. DDB DOCUMENT_DB/NOSQL
Data will be stored in different documents. Each document is independent of others.

Collection as a Table
Each Document is like a ROW.
DATA stroed inside Document

Database{
	Collection-1 {
		Docs{}
		Docs{}
		Docs{}
		...
	}
	Collection-2{
		Docs{ }
		Docs{}
		Docs{}
		...
	}
	...
	Collection-N{
		Docs{}
		Docs{}
		Docs{}
		...
	}
}
Data will be stored in documents.
Eash Document is independent of others.
Not have fixed schema.
Eg: MongoDB


MONGO-DB STRUCURE:
--------------------
MongoDB Physical DB contains several logical DBs.
It logical DB can have multiple Databases.
Each DB contains multiple Collections(Table in RDB).
Each Collection contains multiple Documents(Rows in RDB table).

Ex:
Database: Shopping cart database
	Collections:
		Customer,
		Products,
		Orders
		
How data represented in MongoDB?		
Customer Collection: Contains several documents
document 1:
	{
		'Name' : 'Sujith',
		'Age' : 23,
		'Salary':10000
	}
document 2:
	{
		'Name' : 'Maximus',
	}
document 3:
	{
		"name": "Bunny",
		"Age": 30
		"Address":
			{
				"City": "Hyderabad"
			}
		"hobbies":
			[
				{"name" : "Cricket"},
				{"name" : "Swimming"},
				{"name" : "Football"}
			]
	}

Data Represent in MongoDB
In JSON (BSON) Format.
BSON: Binary JSON

------------
- Fetching is Speed
- Performance
- JSON Data representation

Key Characteristics of MongoDB Database?
1. Complete data is available in single place. Hence, retrieval of data is extreamly fast and not need Join operations.
2. Documents are independent of each other and no scheme. Hence, we can store unstructured data like videos, audio file etc.
3. CRUD operations on documents are strinless.
4. Retrieval data is in the form of JSON which can be understandable by any programming language without any conversation(Interoperability).
5. Huge amout of data can be stored. Scalablity is more.
6. Installation and setup is very easy.

Note: Performance and flexible are biggest assets of MongoDB.
