Learning how to drive is a lot easier than it looks. It looks intimidating from the passenger's seat, butonce you get behind the wheel and gently put your foot on the pedal, the process becomes very intuitive.

Familiarize yourself with the foot pedals.

In an automatic car, the two-foot pedals control acceleration and braking, respectively.
1 ACCELERATOR
2. BREAK

Your car should have three mirrors
1. REAR-VIEW MIRROR
2. OUTSIDE MIRROR


Know where the parking brake (also called a handbrake, e-brake or emergency brake) is and what it does. 
The parking brake is a longer lever with a button on the very tip of it.

GEAR STICK/ROD
Get a feel for the gear stick (also called shift lever, gear lever, shifter or simply, "the stick").

It controls the gearbox (park, neutral, drive, reverse)

DASHBOARD
Understand the basic dashboard controls/symbols.

1. SEEPDOMETER
2. FUEL GAUGE travels between "F" and "E," with "E" signaling "empty" and "F" signaling "full."
3. RPM (revolutions per minute) The RPM gauge tells you how hard your engine is working.
4. TEMPERATURE GUAGE
The temperature gauge in the car tells you whether your car's engine is overheating. It usually has a dial that travels between "H" and "C," signaling "hot" and "cold."
