• Only the best thing I did was washing my cloths. A part form that I didn't do anything.
• Actually, to my shame, all I did was talk on the mobile.

NOW I WANTED TO BE ALONE. ONLY ONE GIRL IS ENOUGH FOR ME.


ROOM RENT
* My friends asked me for room rent. I told them  I would arrange by the end of the day. However, I couldn't. I don't wanna get bad reputation regarding this. I wanted to ask Soundharya for 2k, but she only gets limited salary that was why I couldn't feel good to ask her.

WHATEVER THE JOB
I wanted to get into a job. I don't even care about the salary. I need something I could rely on. Without job is making me confidence less. Money flow makes our life a magical thing.
