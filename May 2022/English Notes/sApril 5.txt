April 29

* I get my haircut but not in regular shaloon shop but differnet one. I downloaded an image and show him to make like that. But in the end he failed it. I have no one to impress so I hadn't got much angry.

* Adding fuel to the fire, when I back home. I had done my clean shave. On No, I was looking like slum.

* Read a chapter in a Essentialism book. I wanna complete that with in no time.

* I am reading Bible additional to that I was writting notes.

JOURNEY BACK TO HYD
I wanted to go back to HYD, that is why I wanted haircut. 
"I need to get a job" is the only thing in my mind.

SWATHI
* No I had just lost the change to meet Swathi Calvary. May 4th is her birthday. However, I lost the change to meet her. I don't wanna show my face to her like this.
She looks like a model girl, me on the another hand not even have a minimal style.

* She told me to wait for her while I was sleeping. I was terribly sleepy but I had to wait for her to come online after her bath. We continue talking on the phone unitl 4am.

* We both unable to stop the conversation. It was more intersting than ever.

I don't know how she reacts when she saw me, my biggest insecurity is my Teeth. I don't know how to make the things right.
