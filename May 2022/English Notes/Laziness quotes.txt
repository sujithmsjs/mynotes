Avoiding a fight is a mark of honor;

SUCCESS IS NOT FOR THE LAZY
Those too lazy to plow in the right season will have no food at the harvest.
Pro 20:4

“For even when we were with you, we would give you this command: If anyone is not willing to work, let him not eat.”
2 Thess 3:10 

- Lazy people destroy what they have and what ther're given.
- God put Adam in the garden to work and take care of it. God provides for us through work.
- If you love sleep, you will end in poverty.
    Keep your eyes open, and there will be plenty to eat!
- Laziness is a curse, but work is a blessing.
- You get what you work for.
- Lazy people are always busy.
- People who are in the habit of enjoying the confort of inaction often pay a high price in the end.
- Fight your fear, your laziness, your ignorance before you worry about fighting the competition.
- Babe, that move you are scared to make, might be the game changer.

- Being a sloth brings down your confidence and motivation.
- “Hard work pays off in the future but laziness pays off now.”
