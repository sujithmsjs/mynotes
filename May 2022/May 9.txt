• I went to visit all three consultencies.
1. JSpiders: I felt I should have attended this before.
2. SP Globals: They asked for my two months' salary as well as one original document.
3. HEIT Solutions: The is the offer I didn't expect before. They're asking me 3 lakhs in order to get a 8 lakhs package job.

Of the three options, I need to choose one.
If I had some experience about how software companies work, then it would be much easier for me to join in the third options. However, it freaks me out.

I picked up Sranivas at Panjagutta. We both went to JSpiders and enquired about the placements. After sometime they told us they only refer people who were trained in their organization.

Room> Panjagutta> KPHB> SR Nager> Panjagutta> Begampet > Prakash nagar> Tharnaka > OU > RTC Cross roads > Room.

After I had successfully visited all three places, I gave a small treat to myself.
