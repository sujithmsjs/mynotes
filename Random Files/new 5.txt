4.2 Variables

EXPRESSION BASIC OBJECTS
When evaluating OGNL expressions on the context variables, some objects are made available to expressions for higher flexibility. These objects will be referenced (per OGNL standard) starting with the symbol:#

#ctx: the context object.
#vars: the context variables.
#locale: the context locale.
#request: (only in Web Contexts) the object.HttpServletRequest
#response: (only in Web Contexts) the object.HttpServletResponse
#session: (only in Web Contexts) the object.HttpSession
#servletContext: (only in Web Contexts) the object.ServletContext

Eg:-

Established locale country: <span th:text="${#locale.country}">US</span>.
